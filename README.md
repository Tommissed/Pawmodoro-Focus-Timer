Pawmodoro: Focus Timer, using the Cat Facts API

This is my pomodoro focus timer app. It's main function is to time 25 minutes of focus and to time either a 5 or 15 minute break. It uses the Cat Facts API to allow the user to distract themselves from their work without taking them away from their work for too long.

My reasoning behind creating this app, was that I found that a lot of people have a fairly short attention span when it comes to doing work and having a non-time consuming way to distract oneself would overrall help them focus in the long run. During testing, by playing with the cat facts, I felt less inclined to go find another way to waste time. 

I use the cat facts API provided by herokuapp. My code can be found in the ViewController.swift file.
